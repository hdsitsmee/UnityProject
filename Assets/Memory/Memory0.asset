  stories:
  - Small mint seeds, hardened in a pocket, that never had the chance to touch the
    earth.
  - An old watering can left alone on parched soil, and a sapling that withered while
    waiting for its owner.
  - 'Whispers of forest spirits echoing in the wind: "Your garden has already bloomed
    in our hearts.'
