  stories:
  - The lonely weight of a throne devoid of warmth; silence as cold as ice in a golden
    goblet.
  - A wish to be seen as a 'human' rather than a 'king,' more desperate than the
    cheers of his people.
  - 'Sincerity in a cup of tea, shining brighter than a crown: "This was the only
    thing missing for one who had everything.'
